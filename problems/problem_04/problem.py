# > Note: Make sure to sort the output list in ascending order

# ## Input Format:
# - List[int] (e.g., [1, 2, 3])

# ## Output Format:
# - List[int]

# ## Constraints:
# - Lists will only be composed of integers

# ## Sample:
# Consider the following two lists:


# | Input                                  | Output               |
# | -------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
